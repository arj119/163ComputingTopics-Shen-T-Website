                <p data-aos="fade" style="font-family: Anaheim, sans-serif;">Currently, common surgical procedures require a large cut in the surgery area. Surgeons then use a variety of special tools to conduct operations in the area.&nbsp;Minimally invasive surgery is a different type of surgery that only requires
                    a small cut. Since normal tools can’t be used, a flexible robotic tool is used to conduct operations. It has several advantages compared to standard surgical procedures.</p>
                <p data-aos="fade" style="font-family: Anaheim, sans-serif;">Open cuts can cause infections easily if not properly treated. A smaller cut reduces the chances of infection significantly. It also heals faster than a large cut and therefore reduces a patient’s recovery time. This helps reduce a patient’s
                    trauma.&nbsp;Minimally invasive surgery does however have some challenges:&nbsp;The workspace is very small and confined, limiting the operations possible. Because of the small area, only specific flexible tools can be used for surgery.
                    Since it may not be possible to maneuver the tools on spot, the procedure has to be remotely controlled.</p>
                <p data-aos="fade" style="font-family: Anaheim, sans-serif;">A continuum robot can be used for these procedures. It is flexible and can navigate easily in fixed space. The commercially available for such robots have several disadvantages: there is no haptic feedback, hand-eye coordination is difficult
                    and the maneuverability varies between the master and slave robot.&nbsp;Shen’s project:&nbsp;Controller can be manipulated in 3 dimension space. It can give haptic feedback to prevent injury to patient and provide better control. It
                    also provides better hand-eye coordination by using a VR headset so that the surgeon can see in 3D space.</p>

                <h1 data-aos="fade">Continuum Robot</h1>
                <p data-aos="fade">Continuum robots, also known as “snake-arm robots” or even “elephant trunk robots” are long and flexible robots capable of avoiding obstacles and following sinuous and exiguous paths thanks to their structure. The first robot of this kind,
                    the Scripps Tensor Arm, born in 1968, was a spine-like elephant trunk arm controlled by nylon microfilaments. Since then, the field has evolved to the point where robots capable of performing Minimal Impact Cardiac Surgery (MICS) now
                    exist. These robots have several industrial applications: maintenance of nuclear-related infrastructures, aerospace: reparation of jet engines..., bomb disposal, search and rescue (after tsunamis, earthquakes), and of course robotic
                    surgery.</p>
                <p data-aos="fade">Snake-arm robots are formed by: a base comprising the motors controlling the body; a body, which is a collection of vertebra like patented links held together by groups of cables; the head, usually containing lamps, a camera to help humans
                    guide the robot and tools according to its application (sensors, water hose, laser...). Groups of cables have different lengths, dividing the robot into individually controlled segments. The number and size of segments / links depends
                    on the length of the robot, how flexible it needs to be and the load it must carry. To make the robot move, or bend in certain direction, the motors either retract or release the cables of the needed segment, and the force generated
                    will force certain links to bend. In order to stabilize the structure, the robot is equipped with springs, which are bent during movement and unload to help the structure remain stable when straightened out.</p>
                <p data-aos="fade">The use of continuum robots in surgery is revolutionary. It replaces rigid endoscope instruments, which due to their structure, had limited abilities. Continuum robots are used in what is called Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic
                    Surgery (NOTES), which includes transoral and transanal (Shen’s field) surgery; but also, minimally invasive surgery (e.g. MICS). One of the most popular FDA approved surgical continuum robots is the Flex robot, conceived by Medrobotics,
                    which is used to access confined body areas.</p>
                <p data-aos="fade">Continuum robots are ground-breaking for both for patients and surgeons. Because the robot is very agile and can access body parts through extremely sinuous and narrow paths, the doctors don’t need to perform open surgery. Therefore, the
                    patients undergo less pain, the operation and recovery time will be shorter, infection risks during the operation are considerably reduced, as well as blood loss. For the surgeon, the use of a robot is very practical as he can observe
                    the surgical area in detail thanks to the camera equipped on the robot. Also, the robot’s tools are extremely precise and adjustable, enhancing the surgeon’s dexterity, avoiding the risk of shaky hands... This allows him to operate
                    faster and with less pressure.</p>

                <h1 data-aos="fade" style="font-family: Anaheim, sans-serif;">Controller</h1>
                <p data-aos="fade" style="font-family: Anaheim, sans-serif;">The controlling device of the continuum robot is crucial for the success of the performed medical procedures. The controller should ideally provide not only smooth, accurate and natural control of the robot, but also information, feedback
                    and assistive tools allowing the human operator to perform surgeries with unprecedented accuracy. The controlling device can be of many forms – from the most basic ones such as mouse, keyboard or joystick to highly sophisticated apparatuses
                    suitable for the full 3D control. Such specialized devices are called master controllers while the controlled robot is usually labeled as slave robot.</p>
                <p data-aos="fade" style="font-family: Anaheim, sans-serif;">In traditional operations, surgeons typically use rigid instruments and can hence easily feel contact with tissues in operated area or even recognize the texture of the surface. Currently used master controller devices typically do not
                    provide such haptic feedback which forces the human operator to rely exclusively on the visual perception. This constraint increases the risk of accidental damage to the tissues and makes the control of the continuum robots significantly
                    more difficult. Shen Treratanakulchai and the Hamlyn Centre are currently working on a controller that provides an immediate haptic feedback for the operator making robotic surgery safer and more accessible to medical specialists inexperienced
                    in this area. Haptic perception can also help to differentiate various types of human tissues including cancerous ones.</p>
                <p data-aos="fade" style="font-family: Anaheim, sans-serif;">The master controller also has to provide hardware and software suitable for control of the highly flexible continuum robot. Commercially available master devices typically allow fewer degrees of freedom than the continuum robots which
                    results in mismatch that might be confusing for human operators. Additionally, currently used master controllers are often limited to control of a particular part of the continuum robot such as the instrument placed at the tip of the
                    robot, or the main body of the robot without the instrument. The controller developed at the Hamlyn Centre aims to mitigate these constraints.</p>

                <h1 data-aos="fade">The Future</h1>
                <p data-aos="fade">With the development of a continuum robot with a controller that can be manipulated in three-dimensional space, the precision of such surgeries is greatly increased thus reducing the risk of unintentional damage. The haptic feedback element
                    of the continuum robot is of high importance, as it must be error-free.</p>
                <p data-aos="fade">Once integrated into existing clinical procedures, both the patients and the surgeons will benefit from the use of advanced surgical robots. Patients will see better outcomes alongside faster recovery times predominantly due to minimally
                    invasive surgery. Surgeons can use devices with increased dexterity, haptic feedback and overall provide better clinical care. With further advances such as these, it may soon be possible to perform procedures in isolated areas which
                    are not as easily accessible by conventional means. With the advent of low latency networks, medical procedures can be performed remotely over great distances<br>with the necessary precision.</p>
                <p data-aos="fade">The area of robotic-assisted surgery is evolving at an ever-increasing rate alongside the development of technology and a rise in demand. The growth of the market is encouraging surgeons to use robots as part of their surgical procedures.
                    The continuum robot which uses an advanced controller and integrates haptic feedback, is a good example of how surgery can be simplified. There may be many more which can be underlined in future research of<br>the area. However, further
                    studies are required to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of using robots in clinical surgeries where real human lives are at high risk. Whilst, initial data suggests that robotic-assisted surgeries produce similar results to conventional
                    procedures, development must be rigorously tested in order to reduce risks. With the success of the continuum robot and others like it, it is expected that funding for medical robotic applications will continue.</p>

                <p data-aos="fade" style="font-family: Anaheim, sans-serif;">Shen Treratanakulchai attended Mahidol University in Thailand, receiving his bachelor’s degree with Distinction Program in Biomedical Engineering, where for his senior project he explored: Simulation and Image Reconstruction for Magnetic
                    Resonance Imaging. Following this Shen also received his master's degree in biomedical engineering where he wrote his Master Thesis: Fusion Sensory Schemes for Real-Time Survival Searching on Extreme-Terrain Rescue Robot. Currently
                    Shen is a PhD student at Imperial College London where his research title is “A Controller for Continuum Robot in Medical Application”. He is doing his research under supervision from Prof. Guang-Zhong Yang at the Hamlyn Centre.</p>
                <p
                    data-aos="fade" style="font-family: Anaheim, sans-serif;">The Hamlyn Centre, named after Lady Helen Hamlyn of the Helen Hamlyn Trust, is part of the Institute of Global Health Innovation (IGHI). It was founded for evolving safe, effective and accessible technologies that can reshape the future
                    of healthcare for both developing and developed countries; focusing on research in imaging, sensing and robotics for addressing global health challenges.</p>
                    <p data-aos="fade" style="font-family: Anaheim, sans-serif;">A particular area that the Hamlyn Centre is researching, is the design of lightweight, cost-effective, flexible manipulators with minimum footprint in the operative theatre which should augment the present surgical workflow, rather
                        than modify it completely or become a hindrance to normal procedures. At the Hamlyn Centre they are currently working on the advances of new generation miniaturised and intelligent mechatronic devices and robots for flexible access
                        surgery, as well as investigating new techniques for providing synergistic, more natural control interface between the surgeon and the robot.</p>
                    <p data-aos="fade">Also with developments in smart materials and composites, the Hamlyn Centre has focussed on the improvement of continuum robots and their function in endoluminal procedures. Rather than using rigid links, these robots use new materials
                        and typically bio-inspired mechanical design to offer more dynamic articulation and navigation.</p>
