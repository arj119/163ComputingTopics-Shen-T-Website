            <h1 data-aos="fade" data-aos-delay="150">Overview</h1>
            <p data-aos="fade">Most of the common surgical procedures carried
                out today require a large cut in the operation area. Surgeons then use a variety of tools to operate
                within the area and seal it with stitches after completing the procedure. Aiming to reduce
                the long recovery time caused by the cut, researchers have developed a new method called minimally
                invasive surgery. This method requires small or no incisions for operation (in case of natural orifice
                transluminal endoscopic surgery). Because of the limited operation area, normal tools cannot be used
                hence a flexible robotic tool is required, which are generally continuum robots.
            </p>
            <p data-aos="fade">Shen Treratanakulchai along with the team of researchers at the Hamlyn Centre is
                currently developing a continuum robot for transanal surgery. Controlling it is challenging as it must
                bend to navigate through the body's passages; change its orientation in tri-dimensional space to operate
                on specific areas and provide feedback to the operator to ensure optimal force is used. Shen is working
                on a new type of controller for this robot, which alleviates some of these issues.<br>
            </p>
            <p data-aos="fade">The master controller can be manipulated in 3D space and matches the degrees of freedom
                with the continuum robot's instruments. A virtual-reality headset is worn by the operator to get the 3D
                perspective of the robot's view. Additionally, the controller is able to provide haptic feedback,
                transmitted from the capacitive plates on the continuum robot. &nbsp;An algorithm is used to scale the
                force
                received by the controller, this ensures that the operator will not apply excessive pressure on the
                bodily tissues. This controller designed by Shen aims to provide enhanced control to the operator and
                improve the surgical process.<br>

            <h1 data-aos="fade">Continuum Robot</h1>
            <p data-aos="fade">Continuum robots, also known as “snake-arm” or even “elephant trunk” robots are long,
                flexible robots capable of avoiding obstacles; following sinuous and exiguous paths thanks to their
                structure. The first robot of this kind, the Scripps Tensor Arm (1968), was a spine-like elephant trunk
                arm controlled by nylon microfilaments. Since then, the field has evolved to the point where robots
                capable of performing Minimal Impact Cardiac Surgery (MICS) now exist. These robots have several
                industrial applications: maintenance of nuclear-related infrastructures, aerospace, bomb disposal,
                search and rescue, and of course robotic surgery.<br>
            </p>
            <p data-aos="fade">Snake-arm robots are formed by a base comprised of motors controlling the body. This body
                is a collection of vertebra-like patented links held together by groups of cables. The robot's head
                usually contains lamps, a camera to help the operator guide the robot and its tools according to its
                application (sensors, water hose, laser, etc.). Groups of cables have different lengths, dividing
                the robot into individually controlled segments. The number and size of segments/links depend on the
                length of the robot, how flexible it needs to be and the load it must carry. To make the robot move or
                bend in a certain direction, the motors either retract or release the cables of the needed segment.
                The force generated will bend certain links. In order to stabilise the structure, the robot is equipped
                with springs. These are bent during movement, and unloaded when straightened out to help it remain
                stable.<br>
            </p>
            <p data-aos="fade">The use of continuum robots in surgery is revolutionary. It replaces rigid endoscope
                instruments, which due to their structure, had limited abilities. Continuum robots are used in what is
                called Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES), which includes transoral and transanal
                surgery. One of the most popular FDA approved transurgical continuum robots is the Flex robot, conceived
                by Medrobotics, which is used to access confined body areas.<br>
            </p>
            <p data-aos="fade">Continuum robots are ground-breaking for both patients and surgeons. Since the robot
                is very agile and can access body parts through extremely sinuous and narrow paths, the doctors do not
                need to perform open surgery. Therefore, the patients undergo less pain, the operation and recovery time
                is shorter, infection risks as well as blood loss are reduced. For the surgeon, the use of a robot is
                very practical, as they can observe the surgical area in detail thanks to the camera-equipped robot.
                Also, its tools are extremely precise and adjustable, enhancing the surgeon’s dexterity and avoiding the
                risk of shaky hands. This allows them to operate faster and more safely.<br>

            <h1 data-aos="fade">Controller</h1>
            <p data-aos="fade">The controlling device of the continuum robot
                is crucial for the success of medical procedures. The controller should ideally provide not only smooth,
                accurate and natural control of the robot but also information, feedback, and assistive tools. These
                allow the human operator to perform surgeries with unprecedented accuracy. The controlling device can be
                of many forms – from the most basic ones such as mouse, keyboard or joystick to highly sophisticated
                apparatuses suitable for the full 3D control. Such specialised devices are called master controllers
                while the controlled robot is usually labeled as a slave robot.<br>
            </p>
            <p data-aos="fade">In traditional operations, surgeons typically use rigid instruments and hence easily feel
                contact with tissues in the operated area or even recognize the texture of the surface. Although some of
                the commercially available master controller devices provide haptic feedback, they are usually designed
                for robots with a rigid body and are thus unsuitable for the full control of the continuum robots. Such
                robots commonly allow many degrees of freedom, which poses a considerable technical challenge for the
                design of the controller. Commonly this results in a mismatch between the robot and the controller,
                which is addressed by switching between the control of various parts of the robot.<br>
            </p>
            <h3 data-aos="fade">Shen's Current Project</h3>
            <p data-aos="fade">Shen Treratanakulchai and the Hamlyn Centre are currently developing a controller for
                continuum robots that provides immediate haptic feedback for the operator. This ensures surgery with
                continuum robots is safer and more accessible to medical specialists, who are inexperienced in this
                area. Haptic perception can also help differentiate various types of human tissues including cancerous
                ones. <br>
            </p>
            <p data-aos="fade">The full master controller will be composed of the console with virtual reality headset
                and two attached controlling devices, which control the corresponding arms of the robot. &nbsp;The base
                of
                controlling arm is equipped with motors providing the haptic feedback. The device aims to allow smooth
                and natural control of the robot's translational and rotational movement as well as the gripping
                instrument placed at the robot's head. Prototypes of the controlling arms are currently being tested at
                the Hamlyn Centre.<br>

            <h1 data-aos="fade">The Future</h1>
            <p data-aos="fade">It is expected that, by the end of the research project, a master controller will be used
                as an instinctive device with transparency properties used to control a continuum robot. The device
                should provide a realistic sensation through haptic feedback and intuitive control which can be used in
                different kinematic contexts. The controller should control the slave robot with smooth movement,
                exerting maximum force in a particular direction through the use of an auxiliary algorithm. The master
                controller should also have a shared control architecture enabling to be applied to different
                kinematics. Finally, the haptic feedback element of the continuum robot must be free of errors.
            </p>
            <p data-aos="fade">Once integrated into existing clinical procedures, both the patients and the surgeons
                will benefit from the use of a master controller. Patients will see better outcomes alongside faster
                recovery times predominantly due to minimally invasive surgery. Surgeons can use devices with increased
                dexterity, haptic feedback and overall provide better clinical care since the precision of such
                surgeries is greatly increased.
            </p>
            <h3 data-aos="fade">Future Research</h3>
            <p data-aos="fade">The evolution of technology is encouraging surgeons to use robots as part of their
                surgical procedures. There are many ways to optimise robot-assisted surgeries. In this research project,
                haptic feedback was implemented as a method of detecting obstruction. Other features, such as visual
                feedback where the shade of the continuum robot changes colour, have yet to be implemented into master
                controllers in a meaningful way, opening up an opportunity for future research.
            </p>
            <p data-aos="fade">Further studies are also required to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of using
                robots in clinical surgeries. Whilst initial data suggests that robotic-assisted surgeries produce
                similar results to conventional procedures, development must be rigorously tested in order to reduce
                risks. This opens up a discussion regarding the ethics of robotic-assisted surgery.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-left" data-aos="fade">Ethical Aspects of Robotic Surgery</h3>
            <p data-aos="fade">As expected, there are massive ethical repercussions caused by the use of robots within
                surgeries. For example, technology can be fallible and error-prone and this can cause serious injury to
                a patient. How can we ensure the safety of a new type of robotic-assisted surgery? Another aspect to
                consider is the training of surgeons in using continuum robots. An improperly trained surgeon wielding
                the master controller can be dangerous. How can we ensure that a surgeon is properly trained in
                robotic-assisted surgery? These issues must be highlighted and risk to human life must be minimised.

            <p data-aos="fade">The Hamlyn Centre, named after Lady Helen Hamlyn of the Helen Hamlyn Trust, is part of
                the Institute of Global Health Innovation (IGHI). It was founded for evolving safe, effective and
                accessible technologies that can reshape the future of healthcare for both developing and developed
                countries; focusing on research in imaging, sensing, and robotics for addressing global health
                challenges.<br>
            </p>
            <p data-aos="fade">A particular area that the Hamlyn Centre is researching, is the design of lightweight,
                cost-effective, flexible manipulators with a minimal footprint in the operative theatre. These should
                augment the present surgical workflow, rather than modify it completely or become a hindrance to normal
                procedures. The researchers at the Hamlyn Centre are currently developing a new generation of
                miniaturised, intelligent mechatronic devices and robots for flexible access surgery. They are also
                investigating new techniques for providing a synergistic, more natural control interface between the
                surgeon and the robot.<br>
            </p>
            <p data-aos="fade">With developments in smart materials and composites, the Hamlyn Centre has focussed on
                the improvement of continuum robots and their function in endoluminal procedures. Rather than using
                rigid links, these robots use new materials and typically bio-inspired mechanical design to offer more
                dynamic articulation and navigation. <br>
