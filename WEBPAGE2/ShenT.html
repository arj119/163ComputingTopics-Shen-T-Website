                Continuum robots, also known as “snake-arm robots” or even “elephant trunk robots” are long and
                flexible robots capable of avoiding obstacles and following sinuous and exiguous paths thanks to
                their structure. The first robot of this kind, the Scripps Tensor Arm, born in 1968, was a spine-like
                elephant trunk arm controlled by nylon microfilaments. Since then, the field has evolved greatly to
                the point where robots capable of performing Minimal Impact Cardiac Surgery (MICS) now exist. These
                robots have several uses in industry: for maintenance of nuclear-related infrastructures, in
                aerospace: reparation of jet engines..., bomb disposal, search and rescue (after tsunamis, earthquakes),
                and of course robotic surgery. Our field of interest is robotic surgery.
            </p>
            <p>
                Snake-arm robots are formed by: a base comprising the motors controlling the body; a body, which is
                a collection of vertebra like patented links held together by groups of cables; the head, usually
                containing lamps, a camera to help humans guide the robot and tools according to its application
                (sensors, water hose, laser...). Groups of cables have different lengths, dividing the robot into
                individually controlled segments. The number and size of segments / links depends on the length
                of the robot, how flexible it needs to be and the load it must carry. To make the robot move, or
                bend in certain direction, the motors either retract or release the cables of the needed segment,
                and the force generated will force certain links to bend. In order to stabilize the structure,
                the robot is equipped with springs, which are bent during movement and unload to help the structure
                remain stable when straightened out.
            </p>
            <p>
                The use of continuum robots in surgery is revolutionary, both for patients and surgeons. Because the
                robot
                is very agile and can access body parts through extremely sinuous and narrow paths, the doctors don’t
                need
                to perform open surgery. Therefore, the patients undergo less pain, the operation and recovery time will
                be shorter, infection risks during the operation are considerably reduced, as well as blood loss. For
                the surgeon, the use of a robot is very practical as he can observe the surgical area in detail thanks
                to the camera equipped on the robot. Also, the robot’s tools are extremely precise and adjustable,
                enhancing the surgeon’s dexterity, avoiding the risk of shaky hands... This allows him to operate
                faster and with less pressure.

            <h1> The Controller</h1>
            <p>The controlling device of the continuum robot is crucial for the success of the performed medical
                procedures.
                The controller should ideally provide not only smooth, accurate and natural control of the robot, but
                also
                information, feedback and assistive tools allowing the human operator to perform surgeries with
                unprecedented
                accuracy. The controlling device can be of many forms – from the most basic ones such as mouse, keyboard
                or
                joystick to highly sophisticated apparatuses suitable for the full 3D control. Such specialized devices
                are
                called master controllers while the controlled robot is usually labeled as slave robot.
            </p>
            <p>In traditional operations, surgeons typically use rigid instruments and can hence easily feel contact
                with
                tissues in operated area or even recognize the texture of the surface. Currently used master controller
                devices typically do not provide such haptic feedback which forces the human operator to rely
                exclusively
                on the visual perception. This constraint increases the risk of accidental damage to the tissues and
                makes
                the control of the continuum robots significantly more difficult. Shen Treratanakulchai and the Hamlyn
                Centre are currently working on a controller that provides an immediate haptic feedback for the operator
                making robotic surgery safer and more accessible to medical specialists inexperienced in this area.
                Haptic perception can also help to differentiate various types of human tissues including cancerous
                ones.
            </p>
            <p>The master controller also has to provide hardware and software suitable for control of the highly
                flexible
                continuum robot. Commercially available master devices typically allow fewer degrees of freedom than the
                continuum robots which results in mismatch that might be confusing for human operators. Additionally,
                currently
                used master controllers are often limited to control of a particular part of the continuum robot such as
                the
                instrument placed at the tip of the robot, or the main body of the robot without the instrument. The
                controller
                developed at the Hamlyn Centre aims to mitigate these constraints.

            <p style="color: white">
                Shen Treratanakulchai attended Mahidol University in Thailand, receiving his Bachelor degree
                with Distinction Program in Biomedical Engineering, where for his senior project he explored:
                Simulation and Image Reconstruction for Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Following this Shen also
                received his Master degree in Biomedical Engineering where he wrote his Master Thesis: Fusion
                Sensory Schemes for Real-Time Survival Searching on Extreme-Terrain Rescue Robot. Currently
                Shen is a PhD student at Imperial College London where his research title is “A Controller
                for Continuum Robot in Medical Application”. He is doing his research under supervision from
                Prof. Guang-Zhong Yang at the Hamlyn Centre.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Hamlyn Centre, named after Lady Helen Hamlyn of the Helen Hamlyn Trust, is part of the
                Institute of Global Health Innovation (IGHI). It was founded for evolving safe, effective and
                accessible technologies that can reshape the future of healthcare for both developing and developed
                countries; focusing on research in imaging, sensing and robotics for addressing global health
                challenges.

            </p>
            <p>
                A particular area that the Hamlyn Centre is researching, is the design of lightweight, cost-effective,
                flexible manipulators with minimum footprint in the operative theatre which should augment the present
                surgical workflow, rather than modify it completely or become a hindrance to normal procedures. At the
                Hamlyn Centre they are currently working on the advances of new generation miniaturised and intelligent
                mechatronic devices and robots for flexible access surgery, as well as investigating new techniques
                for providing synergistic, more natural control interface between the surgeon and the robot.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also with developments in smart materials and composites, the Hamlyn Centre has focussed on the
                improvement of continuum robots and their function in endoluminal procedures. Rather than using rigid
                links, these robots use new materials and typically bio-inspired mechanical design to offer more dynamic
                articulation and navigation.
